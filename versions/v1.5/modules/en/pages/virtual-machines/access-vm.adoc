= Access to the Virtual Machine
:revdate: 2025-05-15
:page-revdate: {revdate}

Once the virtual machine is up and running, you can access it using either the Virtual Network Computing (VNC) client or the serial console from the {harvester-product-name} UI.

Additionally, you can connect directly from your computer's SSH client.

== Access with the {harvester-product-name} UI

Virtual machines can be accessed from the UI directly using either VNC or the serial console.

If the VGA display is not enabled on the virtual machine, e.g., the `Ubuntu-Minimal-Cloud` image, the virtual machine can only be accessed with the serial console.

== SSH Access

{harvester-product-name} provides two ways to inject SSH public keys into virtual machines. Generally, these methods fall into two categories. <<Static SSH Key Injection via cloud-init,Static key injection>>, which places keys in the cloud-init script when the virtual machine is first powered on; <<Dynamic SSH Key Injection via Qemu guest agent,dynamic injection>>, which allows keys or basic auth to be updated dynamically at runtime.

=== Static SSH Key Injection via cloud-init

You can provide ssh keys to your virtual machines during the creation time on the `Basics` tab. Additionally, you can place the public ssh keys into your cloud-init script to allow it to take place.

==== Example of SSH key cloud-init configuration:

[,yaml]
----
#cloud-config
ssh_authorized_keys:
  - >-
    ssh-rsa #replace with your public key
----

=== Dynamic SSH Key Injection via Qemu guest agent

{harvester-product-name} supports dynamically injecting public ssh keys at run time through the use of the https://wiki.qemu.org/Features/GuestAgent[qemu guest agent]. This is achieved through the `qemuGuestAgent` propagation method.

[NOTE]
====
This method requires the qemu guest agent to be installed within the guest virtual machine.

When using `qemuGuestAgent` propagation, the `/home/$USER/.ssh/authorized_keys` file will be owned by the guest agent. Changes to that file that are made outside of the qemu guest agent's control will get deleted.
====

You can inject your access credentials via the {harvester-product-name} UI by performing the following steps:

. Select the virtual machine.

. Select *â‹® -> Edit Config*.

. On the *Access Credentials* tab, add either basic authentication credentials or SSH keys.
+
You can only add a user that already exists in the guest operating system. For example, if you are using openSUSE, you can add the user `opensuse` and select SSH keys.

. Click *Save*.

. Verify that the QEMU guest agent is already installed.

. Restart the virtual machine.

[NOTE]
====
You need to enter the virtual machine to edit password or remove SSH-Key after deleting the credentials from the UI.

=== Access with the SSH Client

Once the virtual machine is up and running, you can enter the IP address of the virtual machine in a terminal emulation client, such as PuTTY. You may also run the following command to access the virtual machine directly from your computer's SSH client:

[,sh]
----
 ssh -i ~/.ssh/your-ssh-key user@<ip-address-or-hostname>
----
