= Storage Network

{harvester-product-name} uses {longhorn-product-name} to provide block device volumes for virtual machines and pods. If you want to isolate {longhorn-product-name} replication traffic from `mgmt` (the built-in cluster network) or other cluster-wide workloads, you can use a dedicated storage network for better network bandwidth and performance.

For more information, see https://documentation.suse.com/cloudnative/storage/1.8/en/longhorn-system/networking/storage-network.html[Storage Network] in the {longhorn-product-name} documentation.

[NOTE]
====
* Avoid configuring {longhorn-product-name} settings directly, as this can result in unexpected or unwanted system behavior.
* You can only use the {longhorn-product-name} storage network with the default V1 Data Engine. Usage with the V2 Data Engine is not yet supported.
====

== Prerequisites

Before you begin configuring the storage network, ensure that the following requirements are met:

* The network switches are correctly configured, and a dedicated VLAN ID is assigned to the storage network.

* The xref:networking/cluster-network.adoc[cluster network] and xref:networking/vm-network.adoc#_vlan_network[VLAN network] are configured correctly. Ensure that both networks cover all nodes and are accessible.

* The IP range of the storage network has the following characteristics:
+
** Uses the IPv4 CIDR format
+
** Does not conflict or overlap with Kubernetes cluster networks
+
The following addresses are reserved: `10.42.0.0/16`, `10.43.0.0/16`, `10.52.0.0/16`, and `10.53.0.0/16`.
+
** Covers the requirements of the cluster
+
The required number of IP addresses is calculated using the following formula: `Required number of IPs = (Number of nodes * 2) + (Number of disks * 2) + Number of images to be downloaded or uploaded`
+
Example: If a cluster has five nodes with two disks each, and ten images are to be uploaded simultaneously, the IP range should be greater than or equal to `/26` (calculation: (5 x 2) + (5 x 2) + 10 = 30).
+
** Excludes IP addresses that {longhorn-product-name} pods and the storage network must not use, such as addresses reserved for xref:integrations/rancher/csi-driver.adoc#_rwx_volumes_support[RWX volumes], the gateway, and other components.

* The Whereabouts CNI is installed correctly.
+
You can check if the `ippools.whereabouts.cni.cncf.io` CRD exists in the cluster using the command `kubectl get crd ippools.whereabouts.cni.cncf.io`.
+
If an empty string is returned, add the CRDs in https://github.com/harvester/harvester/tree/v1.1.0/deploy/charts/harvester/dependency_charts/whereabouts/crds[this directory] using the following commands:
+
[,console]
----
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harvester/harvester/v1.1.0/deploy/charts/harvester/dependency_charts/whereabouts/crds/whereabouts.cni.cncf.io_ippools.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harvester/harvester/v1.1.0/deploy/charts/harvester/dependency_charts/whereabouts/crds/whereabouts.cni.cncf.io_overlappingrangeipreservations.yaml
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The Whereabouts CNI is not installed correctly in certain https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3168[upgrade scenarios].
====

* All virtual machines are stopped.
+
You can check the status of virtual machines using the command `kubectl get -A vmi`, which should return an empty string.
+
[CAUTION]
====
{harvester-product-name} sends a graceful shutdown signal to virtual machines that are stopped using the {harvester-product-name} UI. However, workloads are interrupted and remain unavailable until you manually start the virtual machines after confirming that the storage network configuration was applied successfully.
====

* All pods that are attached to {longhorn-product-name} volumes are stopped.

* All ongoing image uploads and downloads are either completed or deleted.

== {longhorn-product-name} replication traffic routing

The routing of {longhorn-product-name} replication traffic depends on whether virtual machine VLAN traffic and the {longhorn-product-name} storage network share the same physical interfaces or use different ones.

* *Same physical interfaces*: In the following example, both `eth2` and `eth3` are used for virtual machine VLAN traffic and the {longhorn-product-name} storage network. The red line indicates that {longhorn-product-name} sends replication traffic through `eth3`.
+
image::storagenetwork/storagenetwork-same.png[storagenetwork-same.png]
+
[NOTE]
====
You must include `eth2` and `eth3` in the cluster network and VLAN network configuration.
====

* *Different physical interfaces*: In the following example, `eth2` and `eth3` are used for virtual machine VLAN traffic, while `eth4` and `eth5` are used for the {longhorn-product-name} storage network. The red line indicates that {longhorn-product-name} sends replication traffic through `eth4`.
+
image::storagenetwork/storagenetwork-diff.png[storagenetwork-diff.png]
+
[NOTE]
====
You must include `eth4` and `eth5` in the cluster network and VLAN network configuration.
====

== `storage-network` setting

The xref:../installation-setup/config/settings.adoc#_storage_network[`storage-network`] setting allows you to configure the network used to isolate in-cluster storage traffic when segregation is required.

You can enable and disable the storage network using either the UI or the CLI. When the setting is enabled, you must construct a Multus `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` CRD by configuring certain fields.

Once the `storage-network` setting is applied, {harvester-product-name} performs the following actions:

* Stops all pods that are related to {longhorn-product-name} volumes, Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager, and the VM Import Controller.
* Creates a new `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` and updates the {longhorn-product-name} storage network setting.
* Restarts all {longhorn-product-name} pods (`instance-manager-r`, `instance-manager-e`, and `backing-image-manager`) to apply the new network configuration.

. Test the communication between the {longhorn-product-name} pods.
+
The storage network is dedicated to internal communication between {longhorn-product-name} pods, resulting in high performance and reliability. However, the storage network still relies on the xref:./deep-dive.adoc#_external_networking[external network infrastructure] for connectivity (similar to how the xref:./vm-network.adoc#_create_a_vm_with_vlan_network[VM VLAN network] functions). When the external network is not connected and configured correctly, you may encounter the following issues:
+
* The newly created virtual machine becomes stuck at the `Not-Ready` state.
* The `longhorn-manager` pod logs include error messages.
+

.. (Optional) Troubleshoot issues.
+
The storage network may malfunction because of issues with the external network, such as the following:
+
** Physical NICs (installed on {harvester-product-name} nodes) that are associated with the storage network were not added to the same VLAN in the external switches.
** The external switches are not correctly connected and configured.

Once the configuration is verified, you can manually start virtual machines when necessary.

== Best practices

* When configuring an IP range for the storage network, ensure that the allocated IP addresses can service the future needs of the cluster. This is important because {longhorn-product-name} pods (`instance-manager` and `backing-image-manager`) stop running when new nodes are added to the cluster or more disks are added to a node after the storage network is configured, and when the required number of IPs exceeds the allocated IPs. Resolving the issue involves reconfiguring the storage network with the correct IP range.
+
{longhorn-product-name} pods use the storage network as follows:
+
** `instance-manager` pods: Instance Manager components were https://longhorn.io/docs/1.5.0/deploy/important-notes/#instance-managers-consolidated[consolidated in {longhorn-product-name} v1.5.0]. Each node requires one IP address. During an upgrade, both old and new versions of these pods exist, and the old version is deleted once the upgrade is completed.
+
** `backing-image-ds` pods: These pods process on-the-fly uploads and downloads of backing image data sources, and are removed once the image uploads and downloads are completed.
+
** `backing-image-manager` pods: Each disk requires one IP address. During an upgrade, both old and new versions of these pods exist, and the old version is deleted once the upgrade is completed.

* Configure the storage network on a non-`mgmt` cluster network to ensure complete separation of the {longhorn-product-name} replication traffic from the Kubernetes control plane traffic. Using `mgmt` is possible but not recommended because of the negative impact (resource and bandwidth contention) on the control plane network performance. Use `mgmt` only if your cluster has NIC-related constraints and if you can completely segregate the traffic.
