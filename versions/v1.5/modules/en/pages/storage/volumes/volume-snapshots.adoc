A volume snapshot represents a snapshot of a volume on a storage system. After creating a volume, you can create a volume snapshot and restore a volume to the snapshot's state. With volume snapshots, you can easily copy or restore a volume's configuration.

== Create Volume Snapshots

You can create a volume snapshot from an existing volume by following these steps:

. Go to the *Volumes* page.
. Choose the volume that you want to take a snapshot of and select *⋮ > Take Snapshot*.

. Select  *Create* to finish creating a new volume snapshot.
. Check the status of this operation and view all volume snapshots by going to the *Volumes* page and selecting the *Snapshots* tab. When the *Ready To Use* becomes *√*, the volume snapshot is ready to use.
