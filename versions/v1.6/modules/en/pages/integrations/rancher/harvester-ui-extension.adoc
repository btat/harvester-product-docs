== Limitations

=== {harvester-product-name} v1.2.x and earlier are not supported

When you import a cluster that is running {harvester-product-name} v1.2.x or earlier, an error message appears and the cluster link is disabled.

The **Manage** button is still available in {rancher-short-name} 2.11.0, but it will be disabled in a future release. For more information, see issue https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/8054[#8054].

[CAUTION]
====
Avoid using the *Manage* button on the {rancher-short-name} UI if your clusters are running {harvester-product-name} v1.2.x or earlier. Managing clusters using this feature may result in unexpected behavior.
