== Known issues

=== 1. Virtual machines that use migratable RWX volumes restart unexpectedly

Virtual machines that use migratable xref:integrations/rancher/csi-driver.adoc#_rwx_volumes_support[RWX volumes] restart unexpectedly when the CSI plugin pods are restarted. This issue affects {harvester-product-name} v1.4.x, v1.5.0, and v1.5.1.

The workaround is to disable the setting https://documentation.suse.com/cloudnative/storage/1.8/en/longhorn-system/settings.html#_automatically_delete_workload_pod_when_the_volume_is_detached_unexpectedly[Automatically Delete Workload Pod When The Volume Is Detached Unexpectedly] on the {longhorn-product-name} UI before starting the upgrade. You must enable the setting again once the upgrade is completed.

The issue will be fixed in {longhorn-product-name} v1.8.3, v1.9.1, and later versions. {harvester-product-name} v1.6.0 will include {longhorn-product-name} v1.9.1.
