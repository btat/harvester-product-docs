SUSE® Virtualization makes optional functionality available as add-ons.

One of the key reasons for the same is to ensure that SUSE® Virtualization installation footprint can be kept low while allowing users to enable/disable functionality based on their use case or requirements.

Some level of customization is allowed for each add-on, which depends on the underlying add-on.
