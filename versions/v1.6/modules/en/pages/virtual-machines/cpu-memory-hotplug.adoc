Harvester supports CPU and memory hotplug for virtual machines. This feature allows you to increase the CPU and memory resources of a running virtual machine without requiring a reboot.

== Enable CPU and memory hotplug during virtual machine creation

. On the *Virtual Machine:Create* screen, specify the number of CPU cores and memory to be allocated.

. Select *Enable CPU and memory hotplug*.
+
Harvester automatically populates the *Maximum CPU* and *Maximum Memory* fields based on the `max-hotplug-ratio` setting. These values represent the maximum amount of CPU and memory resources that are available to the virtual machine during runtime. You can change these values, if necessary.

. Complete the rest of the virtual machine creation steps.
+
After the virtual machine is created, you can dynamically add CPU and memory resources using the *Edit CPU and Memory* button.

Once you click *Apply*, Harvester migrates the virtual machine to a node with the configured CPU and memory amounts.

== `max-hotplug-ratio` setting

xref:installation-setup/config/settings.adoc#_max_hotplug_ratio[`max-hotplug-ratio`] is a global setting that determines the default maximum amount of CPU and memory resources that are available to a running virtual machine. This ratio is multiplied by the amount of CPU and memory resources that you allocated when you created the virtual machine.

[sidebar]
Maximum available resource at runtime = (Resource allocated during virtual machine creation) x (`max-hotplug-ratio` value)

You can specify a value from `1` to `20`. The default value is `4`.

Example:

The `max-hotplug-ratio` is set to `4`.

|===
| Resource | Allocated Amount | Maximum Available Amount

| CPU cores
| `1`
| `4`

| Memory (Gi)
| `2`
| `8`
