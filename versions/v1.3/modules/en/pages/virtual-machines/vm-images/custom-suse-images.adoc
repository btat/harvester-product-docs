= Custom SUSE VM Images
:revdate: 2025-02-20
:page-revdate: {revdate}

SUSE provides https://www.suse.com/download/sles/[SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLE)] and https://get.opensuse.org/leap/[openSUSE Leap] virtual machine (VM) images suitable for use in {harvester-product-name}. These images are built on the https://build.opensuse.org/[openSUSE Build Service] (OBS) using the https://osinside.github.io/kiwi/[Kiwi] image building tool, and can be used immediately after downloading.

For most cases, you can use the _Minimal VM Cloud_ qcow2 images because these include the cloud-init tool necessary for automatic VM configuration. Other image variants require you to log onto the VM console and then perform initial configuration.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The _Minimal VM Cloud_ images were named _Minimal VM OpenStack Cloud_ in releases earlier than SLES 15 SP5 and openSUSE 15.5.

== Using the openSUSE Build Service (OBS)

You can create custom images based on what SUSE provides using OBS https://build.opensuse.org/image_templates[image templates], which are pre-configured Kiwi image configurations. For example, if you want use other packages with SLE 15 SP5, you can create an image using the _SLE 15 SP5 Minimal_ template. OBS provides an interface for adding packages and automatically builds the image, which you can download and then upload to {harvester-product-name}. For more information, see the https://openbuildservice.org/help/manuals/obs-user-guide/[OBS User Guide].

=== 1. Create a custom image based on an existing template.

. Go to https://build.opensuse.org/image_templates. You must sign in to your openSUSE account to access the resources.
. Select the template that you want to use.
. Specify a name for the image, and then select *Create appliance*.

OBS automatically builds the image. By default, the interface shows the *Overview* tab, which contains information such as the number of included packages and the build status.

=== 2. Select image profiles and add packages.

. Go to the *Software* tab.
. Select the image profiles that you want OBS to build.

=== 3. (Optional) Switch to _View Package_ mode.

_View Package_ mode provides more granular control over configuration. To switch, click the _View Package_ icon in the navigation bar.

The *Source Files* section of the *Overview* tab shows all the files that comprise your Kiwi template. You can edit any of the files by selecting the corresponding file name.

=== 4. (Optional) Edit the configuration file `Minimal.kiwi`.

Select the file name to open the text editor. The `<packages type="image">` section lists the packages to be installed. You can specify additional packages for each image profile.

By default, the _Cloud_ image profile (`<package type="image" profiles="Cloud">`) installs the _kernel-default-base_ package. In the following example, that package is replaced with _kernel-default_, which includes modules necessary for iSCSI support.

=== 5. Wait for OBS to finish building the image.

Once the process is completed, the *Build Results* section on the *Overview* tab shows the status _succeeded_.

The *Build Results* section also contains a download link for the new image.

=== 6. Enable publishing to share the image.

To allow the public to download your custom image, go to the *Repositories* tab of your OBS project and enable the _Publish_ flag.

Your image is published to https://download.opensuse.org/ (under `repositories/home:/YOUR_USER_NAME:/branches:/SUSE:/Templates:/Images:/`).

== Using the Kiwi Command-line Tool

As an alternative to the openSUSE Build Service, you can create images locally using the Kiwi command-line tool. For more information about the tool, see https://documentation.suse.com/appliance/kiwi-9/html/kiwi/index.html[Building Linux System Appliances with KIWI Next Generation (KIWI NG)].

To create custom images, you must first download the file `Minimal.kiwi`, and the scripts `config.sh` and `editbootinstall_rpi.sh` from the corresponding project on OBS.
