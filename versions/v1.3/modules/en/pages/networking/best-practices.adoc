== Replace Ethernet NICs

You may want to replace the Ethernet NICs of a bare-metal node in a {harvester-product-name} cluster for various reasons, including the following:

* Malfunction or damage
* Insufficent hardware capacity
* Missing features

You can follow the steps below and run them in each node step by step.

=== Pre-Replacement Checks

. Verify that the installed {harvester-product-name} version supports the new NICs.
. Test the new NICs in non-production environment.
. On the xref:/virtual-machines/access-vm.adoc#_access_with_the_harvester_ui[*Virtual Machines* screen] of the {harvester-product-name} UI, verify that the status of all VMs is either __Running__ or __Stopped__.
. On the xref:/troubleshooting/cluster.adoc#_access_embedded_rancher_and_longhorn_dashboards[embedded {longhorn-product-name} UI], verify that the status of all {longhorn-product-name} volumes is __Healthy__.
. (Optional) On the *Harvester Support* screen, generate a xref:/troubleshooting/cluster.adoc#_generate_a_support_bundle[support bundle] for comparison purposes.

=== Collect Information

Before any action is taken, it is important to collect the current network information and status.

* {harvester-product-name} network configuration: By default, {harvester-product-name} creates a bond interface named `mgmt-bo` for the management network and one new bond interface for each cluster network. {harvester-product-name} saves network configuration details in the file `/oem/90_custom.yaml`.
+
Example: A NIC named `ens3` was added to the `mgmt-bo` bond interface.
+

      BONDING_SLAVE_0='ens3'
      BONDING_MODULE_OPTS='miimon=100 mode=active-backup '
      DHCLIENT_SET_DEFAULT_ROUTE='no'

    group: 0
    content: |
      STARTMODE='hotplug'
      BOOTPROTO='none'
    encoding: ""
    ownerstring: ""
----

* Physical NICs: You can use the command `ip link` to retrieve related information, including the state of each NIC and the corresponding master (if applicable).
+
Example:
+
----
  $ ip link | grep master -1

  2: ens3: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,SLAVE,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast master mgmt-bo state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
      link/ether 52:54:00:03:3a:e4 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
  --

  4: mgmt-bo: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,MASTER,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue master mgmt-br state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
      link/ether 52:54:00:03:3a:e4 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
----

* PCI devices: You can use the command `lspci` to retrieve a list of devices, which allows you to quickly identify the network NICs. To retrieve detailed information about each device, use the command `lspci -v`.
+
Example (`lspci`):
+
----
  $ lspci

----
+
Example (`lspci -v`):

    I/O ports at c000 [size=64]
    Expansion ROM at fc000000 [disabled] [size=512K]
    Kernel driver in use: e1000
    Kernel modules: e1000
----

* Linux kernel log: You can use the command `dmesg` to display kernel messages, which include most of the required information. If you save the messages to `kernel.log`, you can check the driver and link status.
+
{harvester-product-name} places sub-NICs into the bond interfaces. In the following example, an additional bond interface named `data-bo` is created in the cluster.

=== Enable Maintenance Mode

. (Optional) Stop VMs that cannot or must not be migrated.
. xref:/hosts/hosts.adoc#_node_maintenance[Enable maintenance mode] on the target node to automatically migrate all VMs to other nodes.

* Wait for everything to become ready, and then repeat the steps in the <<Pre-Replacement Checks,Pre-check>> section.
* Manually stop a VM in the following situations:
 ** The VM fails to migrate.
 ** The VM has selectors that prevent it from migrating to other nodes.
 ** The VM has special hardware (for example, PCI passthrough or vGPUs) that prevent it from migrating to other nodes.

=== (Optional) Update the Network Config

There are one or more xref:./cluster-network.adoc#_network_configuration[Network Config] under every xref:./cluster-network.adoc#_cluster_network[Cluster Network] on {harvester-product-name}. Each `Network Config` is backed by a `VlanConfig` CRD object.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Updating the `Network Config` is *required* if the new NICs will be placed in different physical slots or will have different uplink parameters.
====

. Check the node.
+
When a {harvester-product-name} cluster node belongs to a `Network Config`, the `Node` object has a label with the key `network.harvesterhci.io/vlanconfig`.
+
Example:
+
----
 apiVersion: v1
 kind: Node
 metadata:
   labels:
     ...
     network.harvesterhci.io/vlanconfig: vlan123
----

. Remove this node from the `Network Config`.
+
When the new NICs are placed in different slots, you must change the `Network Config` to exclude this node. You can delete the VlanConfig if the `Network Config` object selects only this node from `nodeSelector`.
+
Example:
+
----
 apiVersion: network.harvesterhci.io/v1beta1
 kind: VlanConfig
 spec:
   clusterNetwork: data
   nodeSelector:
     kubernetes.io/hostname: node123  // select one or more nodes
   uplink:
     bondOptions:
       miimon: 100
       mode: 802.3ad
     linkAttributes:
       mtu: 1500
       txQLen: -1
     nics:
     - enp0s1
     - enp0s2
----
+
When VMs are still running on an affected node, the network webhook returns an error.

. Check the `Node` object.
+
Depending on the situation, either the label `network.harvesterhci.io/vlanconfig` changes or is removed.

. Check the `VlanStatus` object.
+
Depending on the situation, either the status of the `VlanStatus` object's `ready` condition changes to `"True"` or the object is deleted.
+
Example:
+
----
 apiVersion: network.harvesterhci.io/v1beta1
 kind: VlanStatus
 metadata:
 ...
 status:
   clusterNetwork: data
   conditions:
   - lastUpdateTime: "2024-02-03T18:32:41Z"
     status: "True"
     type: ready
   linkMonitor: public
   localAreas:
   - cidr: 10.190.186.0/24
     vlanID: 2013
   node: node123
   vlanConfig: vlan123
----

=== (Optional) Drain the Node

You may find that some {longhorn-product-name} replicas remain active on the node even after completing the previously outlined procedures.

. Drain the node. (This is optional in {harvester-product-name}.)
 ** Scenario 1: The `numReplicas` value of all volumes is `3`, which means that each {longhorn-product-name} volume has three active replicas.
+
The Longhorn Engine recognizes that it can no longer communicate with the replica on the drained node, and then marks that replica as failed. None of the replicas hold any special significance to {longhorn-product-name} so it functions as long as it can communicate with at least one replica.

 ** Scenario 2: Some {longhorn-product-name} volumes have _fewer_ than three active replicas, or you manually attached volumes using the {harvester-product-name} UI or {longhorn-product-name} UI.
+
You must manually detach the replicas or move them to other nodes, and then https://documentation.suse.com/cloudnative/storage/1.7/en/troubleshooting-maintenance/maintenance.html#_updating_the_node_os_or_container_runtime[drain the node] using the command `kubectl drain --ignore-daemonsets <node name>`. The option `--ignore-daemonsets` is required because {longhorn-product-name} deploys daemonsets such as Longhorn Manager, Longhorn CSI plugin, and Longhorn Engine image.
+
Replicas running on the node are stopped and marked as `Failed`. Longhorn Engine processes running on the node are migrated with the pod to other nodes. Once the node is fully drained, no replicas and engine processes should remain running on the node.
. Replenish replicas.
+
After a node is shut down, {longhorn-product-name} does not start rebuilding the replicas on other nodes until the `replica-replenishment-wait-interval` (default value: 600 seconds) is reached. If the node comes back online before the wait interval value is reached, {longhorn-product-name} reuses the replicas. Otherwise, {longhorn-product-name} rebuilds the replicas on another node.
+
During system maintenance, you can modify the https://documentation.suse.com/cloudnative/storage/1.7/en/longhorn-system/settings.html#_replica_replenishment_wait_interval[`replica-replenishment-wait-interval`] value using the xref:/troubleshooting/cluster.adoc#_access_embedded_rancher_and_longhorn_dashboards[embedded {longhorn-product-name} UI] to enable faster replica rebuilding.

=== Replace the Nics

. Shut the node down.
. Replace the NICs.
. Restart the node.
. <<Collect Information>> about the current network configuration and status.

If you observe any abnormalities, generate a xref:/troubleshooting/cluster.adoc#_generate_a_support_bundle[support bundle] for troubleshooting purposes.

=== (Optional) Update the Network Config Again

[IMPORTANT]
====
Updating the `Network Config` is *required* if the new NICs will be placed in different physical slots.
====

. Add the node to the `Network Config`.
+
You must create a new `Network Config` or change the `Network Config` to include this node.

. Check the `Node` object.
+
The label `network.harvesterhci.io/vlanconfig` reflects the specific `Network Config` used.

. Check the `VlanStatus` object.
+
The status of the `VlanStatus` object's `ready` condition changes to `"True"`.

=== Disable Maintenance Mode

. Wait for the node to be moved back to the cluster.
. Disable maintenance mode.
. (Optional) Start the VMs that you manually stopped.
. (Optional) Manually xref:/virtual-machines/live-migration.adoc#_starting_a_migration[migrate VMs] to this node.

=== Troubleshooting

{harvester-product-name} uses multiple network-related pods and CRDs. When troubleshooting, check the pod logs and the status of CRD objects.

Pods:

 $ kubectl get pods -n harvester-system
