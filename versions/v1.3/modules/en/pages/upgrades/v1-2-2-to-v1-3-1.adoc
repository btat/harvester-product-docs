== Known Issues

=== 1. Cluster upgrade stuck after the first node is upgraded

[TIP]
====
To prevent this issue from occurring, label the `local-kubeconfig` secret before starting the upgrade process.
`kubectl label secret local-kubeconfig -n fleet-local cluster.x-k8s.io/cluster-name=local`
====

When upgrading a Harvester cluster from v1.2.2 or v1.3.0 to v1.3.1, the upgrade process becomes stuck after the first node is upgraded.

Example:

image::upgrade/known_issues/6041-stuck-on-first-node.png[]

To resolve this issue, perform the following steps:

. Identify the cluster status:
+
[,sh]
----
 kubectl get clusters.provisioning.cattle.io local -n fleet-local -o yaml
----
+
Example of output:
+
[,console]
----
...
  - lastUpdateTime: "2024-06-18T23:37:39Z"
    message: 'configuring bootstrap node(s) custom-9cb22ccf7984: waiting for kubelet to update'
    reason: Waiting
    status: Unknown
    type: Updated
  - lastUpdateTime: "2024-06-18T23:37:39Z"
    message: 'configuring bootstrap node(s) custom-9cb22ccf7984: waiting for kubelet to update'
    reason: Waiting
    status: Unknown
    type: Provisioned
----
+
If the output includes the message `waiting for kubelet`, continue to the next step.
+
. Check the `capi-controller-manager` pod's logs:
+
[,sh]
----
kubectl logs -n cattle-provisioning-capi-system deployment/capi-controller-manager
----
+
If the output is similar to the following example, the issue likely exists in the cluster.
+
[,console]
----

----
+
. Apply the following workaround to resume the upgrade:
+
Kill and restart the `capi-controller-manager` pod.
+
Example:
+
[,sh]
----
 kubectl rollout restart deployment/capi-controller-manager -n cattle-provisioning-capi-system
----

=== 2. Automatic image cleanup is not functioning

Because the published Harvester ISO contains an incomplete image list, automatic image cleanup cannot be performed during an upgrade from v1.2.2 to v1.3.1. This issue does not block the upgrade, and you can use https://github.com/harvester/upgrade-helpers/blob/main/bin/harv-purge-images.sh[this script] to manually clean up container images after the upgrade is completed. For more information, see https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/6620[Issue #6620].
