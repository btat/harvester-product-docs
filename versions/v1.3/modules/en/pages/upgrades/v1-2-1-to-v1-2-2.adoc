:revdate: 2025-05-07
:page-revdate: {revdate}

== General information

An *Upgrade* button appears on the *Dashboard* screen whenever a new {harvester-product-name} version that you can upgrade to becomes available. For more information, see xref:./upgrades.adoc#_start_an_upgrade[Start an upgrade].

For air-gapped environments, see xref:./upgrades.adoc#_prepare_an_air_gapped_upgrade[Prepare an air-gapped upgrade].

== Known issues

=== 1. Upgrade stuck in the `Upgrading System Service` state

Expired certificates of certain system services may cause an upgrade to become stuck in the `Upgrading System Service` state for an extended period. To resolve this issue, perform the following steps:

--
. Identify the name of the `apply-manifest` job.
+
[,sh]
----
 kubectl get jobs -n harvester-system -l harvesterhci.io/upgradeComponent=manifest
----
+
Example output:
+
[,consol]
----
 NAME                                 COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
 hvst-upgrade-9gmg2-apply-manifests   0/1           46s        46s
----

. Check the logs of the `apply-manifest` job.
+
[,sh]
----
 kubectl logs jobs/hvst-upgrade-9gmg2-apply-manifests -n harvester-system
----
+
If the following messages appear in the log, continue to the next step:
+
[,consol]
----
 Waiting for CAPI cluster fleet-local/local to be provisioned (current phase: Provisioning, current generation: 30259)...
 Waiting for CAPI cluster fleet-local/local to be provisioned (current phase: Provisioning, current generation: 30259)...
 Waiting for CAPI cluster fleet-local/local to be provisioned (current phase: Provisioning, current generation: 30259)...
 Waiting for CAPI cluster fleet-local/local to be provisioned (current phase: Provisioning, current generation: 30259)...
----

. Check the state of the Cluster API (CAPI) cluster.
+
[,sh]
----
 kubectl get clusters.provisioning.cattle.io local -n fleet-local -o yaml
----
+
If the output is similar to the following example, the issue likely exists in the cluster.
+
[,consol]
----
     - lastUpdateTime: "2023-01-17T16:26:48Z"
       message: 'configuring bootstrap node(s) custom-24cb32ce8387: waiting for probes:
         kube-controller-manager, kube-scheduler'
       reason: Waiting
       status: Unknown
       type: Updated
----

. Identify the hostname of the affected node, and implement the https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3863#issuecomment-1539681311[workaround] to see if service certificates expire.
+
[,sh]
----
 kubectl get machines.cluster.x-k8s.io -n fleet-local <machine_name> -o yaml | yq .status.nodeRef.name
----
+
Replace `<machine_name>` with the name of the affected node (as stated in the output of the previous step).
+

[NOTE]
====
If multiple nodes joined the cluster around the same time, you must implement the https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3863#issuecomment-1539681311[workaround] on all those nodes.

=== 2. The `harvester-seeder` add-on is not upgraded

When upgrading Harvester clusters from v1.2.1 to v1.2.2, the `harvester-seeder` add-on is not fully upgraded because the Helm chart versions do not match. The `harvester-seeder` chart bundled with Harvester v1.2.2 is of v0.1.1, while the `harvester-seeder` add-on uses the v0.1.0 chart.

[,consol]
----
Error: chart "harvester-seeder" matching 0.1.0 not found in harvester-seeder index. (try 'helm repo update'): no chart version found for harvester-seeder-0.1.0
----

If you enable the add-on after upgrading to Harvester v1.2.2, installing the chart will also not be possible because of the mentioned mismatch.

The workaround is to manually update the `harvester-seeder` add-on manifest using the following command. You must disable the add-on before patching.

[,sh]
----
kubectl -n harvester-system patch addons.harvesterhci harvester-seeder --type=json -p '[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/version", "value": "0.1.1"}]'
----
