= Third-Party Storage Support
:revdate: 2025-07-17
:page-revdate: {revdate}

{harvester-product-name} now offers the capability to install a https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/introduction.html[Container Storage Interface (CSI)] in your {harvester-product-name} cluster. This allows you to leverage external storage for the Virtual Machine's non-system data disk, allowing you to use different drivers tailored for specific needs, whether for performance optimization or seamless integration with your existing in-house storage solutions.

[NOTE]
====
The Virtual Machine (VM) image provisioner in {harvester-product-name} still relies on Longhorn. Before version 1.2.0, {harvester-product-name} exclusively supported Longhorn for storing VM data and did not offer support for external storage as a destination for VM data.
====

== Prerequisites

For the Harvester functions to work well, the third-party CSI driver needs to have the following capabilities:

* Support expansion
* Support snapshot
* Support clone
* Support block device
* Support Read-Write-Many (RWX), for xref:../virtual-machines/live-migration.adoc[Live Migration]

== Create Harvester cluster

Harvester's operating system follows an immutable design, meaning that most OS files revert to their pre-configured state after a reboot. Therefore, you might need to perform additional configurations before installing the Harvester cluster for third-party CSI drivers.

Some CSI drivers require additional persistent paths on the host. You can add these paths to xref:../installation-setup/config/configuration-file.adoc#_os_persistent_state_paths[`os.persistent_state_paths`].

Some CSI drivers require additional software packages on the host. You can install these packages with xref:../installation-setup/config/configuration-file.adoc#_os_after_install_chroot_commands[`os.after_install_chroot_commands`].

[NOTE]
====
Upgrading Harvester causes the changes to the OS in the `after-install-chroot` stage to be lost. You must also configure the `after-upgrade-chroot` to make your changes persistent across an upgrade. Refer to https://rancher.github.io/elemental-toolkit/docs/customizing/runtime_persistent_changes/[Runtime persistent changes] before upgrading Harvester.
====

== Install the CSI driver

After installing the Harvester cluster is complete, refer to xref:../troubleshooting/faq.adoc#_how_can_i_access_the_kubeconfig_file_of_the_harvester_cluster[How can I access the kubeconfig file of the Harvester cluster?] to get the kubeconfig of the cluster.

With the kubeconfig of the Harvester cluster, you can install the third-party CSI drivers into the cluster by following the installation instructions for each CSI driver. You must also refer to the CSI driver documentation to create the `StorageClass` and `VolumeSnapshotClass` in the Harvester cluster.

== Configure Harvester Cluster

Before you can make use of Harvester's *Backup & Snapshot* features, you need to set up some essential configurations through the Harvester xref:../installation-setup/config/settings.adoc#_csi_driver_config[csi-driver-config] setting. Follow these steps to make these configurations:

. Login to the Harvester UI, then navigate to *Advanced* > *Settings*.
. Find and select *csi-driver-config*, and then select *â‹®* > *Edit Setting* to access the configuration options.
. Set the *Provisioner* to the third-party CSI driver in the settings.
. Next, configure the *Volume Snapshot Class Name*. This setting points to the name of the `VolumeSnapshotClass` used for creating volume snapshots or VM snapshots.

=== Virtual Machine Backup Compatibility

* In {harvester-product-name} *v1.4.2 and later versions*, the setting *Backup Volume Snapshot Class Name* cannot be used with external storage. {harvester-product-name} is unable to create backups of volumes in external storage because the backup function is not included in the CSI standard and  there is no way to create a remote backup for differing storage providers. Backup support in {harvester-product-name} is limited to Longhorn V1 Data Engine volumes.
* {harvester-product-name} is unable to restore virtual machine backups with external storage because the data does not have a remote copy.

For more information, see issues https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/7316[#7316], https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/7737[#7737], and https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/7755[#7755].

== Use the CSI driver

After successfully configuring these settings, you can utilize the third-party StorageClass. You can apply the third-party StorageClass when creating an empty volume or adding a new block volume to a VM, enhancing your Harvester cluster's storage capabilities.

With these configurations in place, your Harvester cluster is ready to make the most of the third-party storage integration.

== Known issues

=== 1. Multipath support

The `multipathd` service is disabled in {harvester-product-name} by default. However, certain third-party CSIs may require you to enable the service.

After installing {harvester-product-name}, you can enable and start `multipathd` by logging into each cluster node and running the following commands:

[,shell]
----
systemctl enable multipathd
systemctl start multipathd
----

Alternatively, you can create a {elemental-product-name} CloudInit file in the `/oem` directory on each host (for example, `/oem/99-start-multipathd.yaml`) with the following contents:

[,yaml]
----
stages:
   default:
   - name: "start multipathd"
     systemctl:
       enable:
         - multipathd
       start:
         - multipathd
----

This process can be automated across the Harvester cluster using a `CloudInit` CRD.

[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: node.harvesterhci.io/v1beta1
kind: CloudInit
metadata:
  name: start-mutlitpathd
spec:
  matchSelector:
    harvesterhci.io/managed: "true"
  filename: 99-start-mutlitpathd
  contents: |
    stages:
      default:
        - name: "start multipathd"
          systemctl:
            enable:
              - multipathd
            start:
              - multipathd
  paused: false
