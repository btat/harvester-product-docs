= PCI Devices Controller
:revdate: 2025-05-23
:page-revdate: {revdate}

A `PCIDevice` in SUSE® Virtualization represents a host device with a PCI address.
The devices can be passed through the hypervisor to a VM by creating a `PCIDeviceClaim` resource, or by using the UI to enable passthrough. Passing a device through the hypervisor means that the VM can directly access the device, and effectively owns the device. A VM can even install its own drivers for that device.

This is accomplished by using the `pcidevices-controller` add-on.

To use the PCI devices feature, users need to enable the `pcidevices-controller` add-on first.

Once the `pcidevices-controller` add-on is deployed successfully, it can take a few minutes for it to scan and the PCIDevice CRDs to become available.

== Enabling Passthrough on a PCI Device

. Now go to the `Advanced -> PCI Devices` page:
+
image::pcidevices/advanced-pcidevices-index.png[]

. Search for your device by vendor name (e.g. NVIDIA, Intel, etc.) or device name.
+
image::pcidevices/search-pcidevices.png[]

. Select the devices you want to enable for passthrough:
+
image::pcidevices/select-pcidevices.png[]

. Then click *Enable Passthrough* and read the warning message. If you still want to enable these devices, click *Enable* and wait for all devices to be `Enabled`.
+
[CAUTION]
====
Please do not use `host-owned` PCI devices (e.g., management and VLAN NICs). Incorrect device allocation may cause damage to your cluster, including node failure.

== Attaching PCI Devices to a VM

After enabling these PCI devices, you can navigate to the *Virtual Machines* page and select *Edit Config* to pass these devices.

image::pcidevices/vm-pcidevices-edit-config.png[]

Select *PCI Devices* and use the *Available PCI Devices* drop-down. Select the devices you want to attach from the list displayed and then click *Save*.

== Using a passed-through PCI Device inside the VM

Boot the VM up, and run `lspci` inside the VM, the attached PCI devices will show up, although the PCI address in the VM won't necessarily match the PCI address in the host.

== Installing drivers for your PCI device inside the VM

This is just like installing drivers in the host. The PCI passthrough feature will bind the host device to the `vfio-pci` driver, which gives VMs the ability to use their own drivers.

== Known Issues

* https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/6648[Issue #6648]: A virtual machine can be scheduled on an incorrect node if the cluster has multiple instances of the same PCI device. 

The pcidevices-controller add-on currently uses unique resource descriptors to publish devices to the kubelet. If multiple `PCIDeviceClaims` of the same device type exist within the cluster, the same unique resource descriptor is used for these `PCIDeviceClaims`, and so the virtual machine may be scheduled on an incorrect node. To ensure that the correct device and node are used, select *Run VM on specific node* when configuring *Node Scheduling* settings.

== SR-IOV Network Devices

image::pcidevices/SriovNetworkDevicesLink.png[]

The `pcidevices-controller` add-on can now scan network interfaces on the underlying hosts and check if they support SRIOV Virtual Functions (VFs). If a valid device is found, `pcidevices-controller` will generate a new `SRIOVNetworkDevice` object.

image::pcidevices/SriovNetworkDevicesList.png[]

To create VFs on a SriovNetworkDevice, you can click *⋮ -> Enable* and then define the *Number of Virtual Functions*.

image::pcidevices/SriovNetworkDeviceEnable.png[]

image::pcidevices/SriovNetworkVFDefinition.png[]

The `pcidevices-controller` will define the VFs on the network interface and report the new PCI device status for the newly created VFs.

image::pcidevices/SriovNetworkDevicesVFStatus.png[]

On the next re-scan, the `pcidevices-controller` will create the PCIDevices for VFs. This can take up to 1 minute.

You can now navigate to the *PCI Devices* page to view the new devices.

We have also introduced a new filter to help you filter PCI devices by the underlying network interface.

The newly created PCI device can be passed through to virtual machines like any other PCI device.

== USB Devices

A `USBDevice` resource in Harvester represents a USB device on the node. USB devices can be "passed through" by the hypervisor to allow direct access from VMs. This is accomplished through the `pcidevices-controller` add-on. To use USB passthrough, you can either create a `USBDeviceClaim` resource or enable the feature on the Harvester UI. 

USB passthrough is slightly different from PCI passthrough. For example, you can fully control a USB controller with four USB ports by creating a `PCIDeviceClaim`. However, you can also create a `USBDeviceClaim` to control only one USB port. The other three USB ports remain available to the node.

[CAUTION]
====
Before you remove the USB device, detach it from the virtual machine and then disable passthrough on the *USB Devices* screen.
====

=== Enable Passthrough on a USB Device

. On the Harvester UI, go to *Advanced -> USB Devices*.
+
image::pcidevices/index.png[]
+
. Locate the device in the list.
+
image::pcidevices/search.png[]
+
. Select the target device, and then select *⋮ -> Enable Passthrough*.
+
image::pcidevices/select.png[]
+
. Read the confirmation message, and then click *Enable*.
+
Allow some time for the device state to change to *Enabled*.
+
image::pcidevices/enable-done.png[]

=== Attach a USB Device to a Virtual Machine

. Verify that passthrough is enabled on the target device.
+
. Go to *Virtual Machines*, and then create a virtual machine or edit the configuration of an existing virtual machine.
+
. On the virtual machine configuration screen, go to the *USB Devices* tab and then select a device from the *Available USB Devices* list.
+
image::pcidevices/attach-vm.png[]
+
. Click *Create* or *Save*.

=== View USB Devices Attached to a Virtual Machine

. Start and then access the virtual machine.
+
. Run `lsusb`.
+
This utility displays information about USB buses and attached devices.

=== Limitations

* Virtual machines with attached USB devices cannot be live-migrated because the devices are bound to a specific node.
+
* Hot-plugging and replugging of USB devices is not supported. For more information, see https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/issues/11979[KubeVirt Issue #11979].
+
* If the device path changes when you reattach the device or reboot the node, you must detach the device from the virtual machine and then enable passthrough again.
